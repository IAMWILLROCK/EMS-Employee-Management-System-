# EMS-Employee-Management-System-
This is a total RESTful API with all the neccesary that a typical Resource Management System is requried to have.

This application is built on Spring MVC and Hibernate following Richardson's Maturity Model in mind. Having used Spring MVC has helped me understand a lot of things under the hood
encompassed by Spring in general. The app provides support for reading data from Excel sheets and writing data to them, Image conversion to Base64 Strings. 

This project is a result of my experience with Java and Spring capable of running on Apache Tomcat and SAP Cloud Foundry.
